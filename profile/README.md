## Technical Changes for Future Development

### Web3 and Crypto Integration

AthSpot plans to implement Web3 technologies and integrate cryptocurrencies to further revolutionize the user experience. As part of this development, the following innovations will be introduced:

1. **Crypto Payment Protocol**
   - Introduce a crypto-based payment system allowing users to make payments for services such as booking sports venues, purchasing premium subscriptions, or engaging in in-app purchases using cryptocurrencies.
   - Payments will be processed using popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or platform-specific tokens.

2. **NFTs for Photos**
   - Users will be able to create unique photos from their sports activities and convert them into NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Each photo posted on the platform can be uniquely registered as an NFT, giving it value on the market.
   - NFT photos will be available for sale, and users can store or trade them with others. For each sale of an NFT, users will earn cryptocurrency as a form of compensation.

3. **AthSpot Tokens**
   - Users will earn AthSpot tokens through their activity on the app, such as posting photos, participating in challenges, and gaining points for sports activities. These tokens can be exchanged for in-app services, discounts, or converted into real cryptocurrency.
   - Over time, we plan to create a native AthSpot token, which will become an integral part of the ecosystem and provide deeper integration with Web3.

4. **Decentralization**
   - In the future, AthSpot plans to leverage blockchain technology to decentralize user data, providing greater transparency and security. Users will have full control over their data and will be able to manage it according to Web3 privacy standards.

5. **Tokenized Reservations and Payments**
   - Each booking made through the platform will be tokenized, enabling secure, transparent, and efficient payments using blockchain technology.
